    "The acoustical behaviour of a room is treated from a statistical point of view, based on energy balance considerations. It is assumed that the modal density is high enough, so that the influence of single modes in the room can be neglected. It is also assumed that the reflection density is high enough so that the phase relations between individual reflections can be neglected. This means that the reflections in the room are assumed to be uncorrelated and their contribution can be added on an energy basis.  \n",

    "• All directions of sound propagation occur with the same probability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is obvious that the direct sound field near a sound source is not included in the diffuse sound field. Neither are the special interference phenomena that are known to give increased energy density near the room boundaries and corners. The diffuse sound field is an ideal sound field that does not exist in any room. However, in many cases, the diffuse sound field can be a good and very practical approximation to the real sound field."

It can take values between 0 and 1; $\\alpha=1$ means that all incident sound energy is absorbed in the surface. An example of a surface with absorption coefficient, $\\alpha=1$ is an open window. Sabine in his original paper on reverberation from 1898 suggested the use of open-window unites for the absorption area. The product of area and absorption coefficient of a surface material is the equivalent absorption area of that surface, i.e. the area of open windows giving the same amount of sound absorption as the actual surface.
