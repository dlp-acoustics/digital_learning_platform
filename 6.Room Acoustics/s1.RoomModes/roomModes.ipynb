As a minimum requirement, it has been suggested by Schroeder (1962) that the modal overlap should be $M=3$, although this cannot be considered a very sharp borderline. This leads to a lower limiting frequency for statistical methods, the so-called ***Schroeder’s limiting frequency***, $f_g$, given as,\n",
