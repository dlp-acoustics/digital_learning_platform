    "\n",
    "Generally, our hearing does not perceive reflections with delays of less than about 50 ms as separate acoustical events. Instead, such reflections enhance the apparent loudness of the direct sound, therefore they are often referred to as ‘useful reflections’. The remaining reflections with longer delays are responsible for what is perceived as the reverberation of the room. The relative contribution of useful reflections may be characterised by several parameters derived from the impulse response. One of them is the ‘definition’ or ‘Deutlichkeit’ defined by:\n",

    "Another feature of a reflection is the direction from which it arrives at the listener’s position. Usually, sound reflections do not impair a listener’s ability to localise a sound source in a room although most of the sound energy he receives arrives from other directions than from that of the direct sound. This interesting effect is due to the ‘law of the first wavefront’ mentioned by the end of the preceding chapter. It states that a listener localises the sound source from the direction of the direct sound. Nevertheless, the listener has a certain perception of the great variety of directions involved in the transmission of reflected sounds; it creates what may be called the subjective sensation of space, or the impression of being enveloped by sound.\n",

You get a series of reflections in short time signatures and then that translates into energy moving across the area between those surfaces. This energy movement excites the air between those two surfaces and with that air excitation you get audible distortion. This distortion can occur between walls, cabinets and bookshelves.\n",
