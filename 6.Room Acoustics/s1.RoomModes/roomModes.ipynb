    "Before we discuss the advances in room modes, we start with  one dimensional enclosures, such as, a pipe of finite length with rigid walls. The assumptio we made for such one dimension case is that the lateral dimensions are small enough to guarantee that in the frequency range considered only the fundamental wave can exists and any loss processes as may occur in the medium and at the walls [1].\n",
    "Let us consider a one dimension pipe along x-axis and both the end of the pipe are closed with a rigid plate or lid. Any harmonic sound field within the pipe consists of a standing wave with maximum pressure amplitude occurring at its terminations. This is only possible if an integral number of half-wavelengths fits into the tube length L as shown in the figure below.\n",
