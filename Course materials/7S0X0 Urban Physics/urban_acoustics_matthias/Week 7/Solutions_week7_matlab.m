%% Question 1d: compute LpA in case of snow

% With the snow, Gprime_path is 0.9. The new values for Aground are thus (approximately)
Aground_snow = [-0.5, -0.5, -0.5, 0, 4, 8, 12];

% Re-compute corresponding sound level:

end

% To compute the ground effects we will need to compute additional
% diffraction terms, between the image-source Sp and the receiver R (Ddif_SpR) and

%
% However, here the source is located at zs=0 meter, so the source S and

% Let us now compute the ground attenuation on the source side
% (Aground_SO) and on the receiver side (Aground_OR).

% On the source side of the barrier, Gs_SO and Gpath_SO are both 0 (dense asphalt), so Gprime_path_SO is simply
% 0. From figure 2, we find that
Aground_SO = -3;

% On the receiver side, since the virtual source is the top of
% the barrier O, we have Gs=Gpath=Gprime_path (see Cnossos report, page
% 95). Therefore, with Gpath=0.7, we directly get from figure 2 (very approximately)
Aground_OR = [-0.9, -0.75, -0.9, -0.9, -0.9, -0.9, -0.9];

% we can now compute the terms Dground_SO and Dground_OR as
Dground_SO = -20*log10(1+(10.^(-Aground_SO/20)-1).*10.^(-(Ddif_SpR-Ddif_SR)/20));
Dground_OR = -20*log10(1+(10.^(-Aground_OR/20)-1).*10.^(-(Ddif_SRp-Ddif_SR)/20));

% Therefore, the attenuation due to the barrier (per octave band) is
Adif_barrier = Ddif_SR + Dground_SO + Dground_OR;

% and the sound level is
Lp_barrier = L_WEQ_total -Adiv -Aatm -Aground_barrier -Adif_barrier;
